# Machine Learning Model Deployment

This project involves training a machine learning model using a dataset and deploying it as an API using a framework such as Flask or FastAPI. The deployed model will be accessible for making predictions via HTTP requests. Additionally, the project includes implementing features for monitoring the model's performance 
and managing different versions of the model.

## Features

- __Model Training__: Train a machine learning model using a provided dataset.
- __API Deployment__: Deploy the trained model as an API using Flask, FastAPI, or a similar framework.
- __Real-Time Predictions__: Enable the API to provide real-time predictions based on incoming requests.
- __Model Monitoring__: Implement monitoring to track the model's performance and usage.
- __Model Versioning__: Manage different versions of the model to ensure smooth updates and backward compatibility.

## Utility Functions

- __Data Preprocessing__: Functions to clean and preprocess the dataset before training the model.
- __Model Training__: Scripts to train the machine learning model using libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
- __Prediction Function__: A function to generate predictions using the trained model.
- __API Setup__: Scripts to set up the API endpoints using Flask or FastAPI.
- __Model Monitoring__: Functions to log and monitor the performance and accuracy of the model.
- __Model Versioning__: Scripts to manage different versions of the model and ensure smooth transitions between versions.

## Implementation

- __Data Preprocessing__: Use Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy to clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and normalizing data.
- __Model Training__: Train a machine learning model using Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch. Save the trained model for later use.
- __API Setup__: Use Flask or FastAPI to set up the API, creating endpoints for making predictions, monitoring performance, and managing model versions.
- __Prediction Function__: Develop a function that loads the trained model and generates predictions based on input data from API requests.
- __Model Monitoring__: Implement monitoring to log prediction results, track performance metrics, and detect anomalies.
- __Model Versioning__: Create a system to manage multiple versions of the model, ensuring that API endpoints can specify which version to use.

## Testing

- __Unit Testing__: Test individual functions for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction to ensure they work correctly.
- __API Testing__: Test the API endpoints to ensure they handle requests and responses correctly.
- __Performance Testing__: Test the model's prediction speed and the API's response time to ensure real-time functionality.
- __Accuracy Testing__: Validate the accuracy of the model's predictions using a test dataset.
- __Regression Testing__: Ensure that updates to the model or API do not introduce new issues or degrade performance.

## Example Scenarios

- __Model Training__: Train a classification model using a dataset of labeled examples.
- __API Deployment__: Deploy the trained model as an API using FastAPI.
- __Real-Time Predictions__: Enable the API to provide real-time predictions based on new data sent via HTTP requests.
- __Model Monitoring__: Implement logging and monitoring to track the model's prediction accuracy and API usage.
- __Model Versioning__: Deploy a new version of the model and ensure that it can be accessed alongside the old version for comparison.
